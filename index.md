## About us

**Infrastructure as Code User Group Oslo** aim to bring together people who are interested in Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and related topics. We want to create a community where we can share knowledge, experiences, and best practices in the field of IaC.

Historically, the group has been focused on Bicep DSL and Microsoft Azure, but we are open to other tools and technologies related to IaC, as well as other cloud platforms. We believe that by sharing our knowledge and experiences, we can help each other grow and improve our skills in this area.


### Meetups

We publish all future events on our [Meetup.com group](https://www.meetup.com/infrastructure-as-code-user-group-oslo/). We arrange local in-person, and virtual events as often as we can, but at least once per quarter.
