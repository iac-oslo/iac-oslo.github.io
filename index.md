## About us

**Infrastructure as Code User Group Oslo** aim to bring together people who are interested in Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and related topics. We want to create a community where we can share knowledge, experiences, and best practices in the field of IaC.

Historically, the group has been focused on Bicep DSL and Microsoft Azure, but we are open to all tools and technologies related to IaC. We believe that by sharing our knowledge and experiences, we can help each other grow and improve our skills in this area.

We publish all future events on our [Meetup.com group](https://www.meetup.com/infrastructure-as-code-user-group-oslo/). We arrange local in-person, and virtual events as often as we can, but at least once per quarter.

We publish all the code and presentations from our events on our [GitHub organization](https://github.com/iac-oslo).

We welcome speakers with various backgrounds and level of experience, who want to share their knowledge and experiences with the community. If you are interested in speaking or sponsoring an event, please submit your proposal via our [ Sessionize Call for Speakers](https://sessionize.com/iac-user-group-oslo/) page.

For more real-time discussions, we have a [Slack workspace](https://iacoslo.slack.com) where you can join and chat with other members of the community. We encourage everyone to join and participate in discussions, ask questions, and share their knowledge.

For any questions, suggestions, or feedback, please feel free to contact us at [this email address](mailto:iacusergrouposlo@gmail.com).
